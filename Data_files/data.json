The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village.\n\nThrough circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.76, "rank": 32, "popularity": 755, "num_list_users": 201836, "num_scoring_users": 78636, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2014-06-16T10:15:21+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T02:11:17+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "num_episodes": 10, "start_season": {"year": 2014, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "sunday", "start_time": "00:30"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1430, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/68095.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/68095l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 21939, "title": "Mushishi Zoku Shou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/58533.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/58533l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}, {"node": {"id": 24687, "title": "Mushishi Zoku Shou: Odoro no Michi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63539.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63539l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}, {"node": {"id": 28957, "title": "Mushishi Zoku Shou: Suzu no Shizuku", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72689.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/72689l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "sequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Sequel"}], "related_manga": [], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 2890, "title": "Gake no Ue no Ponyo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8970.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/8970l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 4081, "title": "Natsume Yuujinchou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/108439.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/108439l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 22789, "title": "Barakamon", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/65427.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/65427l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}], "studios": [{"id": 8, "name": "Artland"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "10917", "completed": "102122", "on_hold": "5209", "dropped": "2456", "plan_to_watch": "82955"}, "num_list_users": 203659}}, {"id": 12355, "title": "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/35721.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/35721l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Wolf Children Ame and Yuki"], "en": "Wolf Children", "ja": "\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u3053\u3069\u3082\u306e\u96e8\u3068\u96ea"}, "start_date": "2012-07-21", "end_date": "2012-07-21", "synopsis": "Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student.

Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to the Kamogawa boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo's classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing.

This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively.\n\nCowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 5, "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "side_story", "relation_type_formatted": "Side story"}, {"node": {"id": 4037, "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Yose Atsume Blues", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/54341.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/54341l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "summary", "relation_type_formatted": "Summary"}, {"node": {"id": 17205, "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Ein no Natsuyasumi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/45947.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/45947l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "side_story", "relation_type_formatted": "Side story"}], "related_manga": [], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 205, "title": "Samurai Champloo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/29134.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/29134l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 98}, {"node": {"id": 6, "title": "Trigun", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/20310l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 73}, {"node": {"id": 889, "title": "Black Lagoon", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25596.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25596l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 57}, {"node": {"id": 400, "title": "Seihou Bukyou Outlaw Star", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/28848.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/28848l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 45}, {"node": {"id": 20057, "title": "Space\u2606Dandy", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/56611l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 30}, {"node": {"id": 2251, "title": "Baccano!", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 30}, {"node": {"id": 4087, "title": "Michiko to Hatchin", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/59535.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/59535l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 18}, {"node": {"id": 2025, "title": "Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/19570.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/19570l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 16}, {"node": {"id": 13601, "title": "Psycho-Pass", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43399.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43399l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 13}, {"node": {"id": 918, "title": "Gintama", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73274.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73274l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 13}], "studios": [{"id": 14, "name": "Sunrise"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "109893", "completed": "739798", "on_hold": "74096", "dropped": "27572", "plan_to_watch": "344094"}, "num_list_users": 1295453}}, {"id": 30276, "title": "One Punch Man", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76049.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76049l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["One Punch-Man", "One-Punch Man", "OPM"], "en": "One Punch Man", "ja": "\u30ef\u30f3\u30d1\u30f3\u30de\u30f3"}, "start_date": "2015-10-05", "end_date": "2015-12-21", "synopsis": "The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero.

Not uncultured in the supernatural, Kyon will have to deal with his whole life turned upside down like a bad joke, and maybe it's better that way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.65, "rank": 56, "popularity": 253, "num_list_users": 494097, "num_scoring_users": 254324, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2009-10-08T18:06:42+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T02:26:55+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2010, "season": "winter"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 9720, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/17544.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/17544l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/17779.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/17779l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/17783.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/17783l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19595.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/19595l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/21368.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/21368l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/24646.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/24646l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27751.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27751l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75900.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75900l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75902.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75902l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1867/109034.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1867/109034l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1248/112352.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1248/112352l.jpg"}], "background": "The film won the Best Theatrical Film award at the 2010 Animation Kobe Awards.", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 4382, "title": "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009)", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/75377.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/75377l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}, {"node": {"id": 26351, "title": "Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/73527.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/73527l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "alternative_version", "relation_type_formatted": "Alternative version"}], "related_manga": [], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 11577, "title": "Steins;Gate Movie: Fuka Ryouiki no D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50317.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50317l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 14}, {"node": {"id": 9253, "title": "Steins;Gate", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73199.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73199l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 9}, {"node": {"id": 38329, "title": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1613/102179.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1613/102179l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 6}, {"node": {"id": 32281, "title": "Kimi no Na wa.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87048.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87048l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 13667, "title": "Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 6 -

Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yutaka Hoshino, nicknamed Smile and Peco respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport.\n\nEvery year, students from all across Japan gather for the inter-high table tennis competition to achieve national and international stardom. Through intense training and competition, only the very best persevere.\n\nFrom the avant-garde director of Tatami Galaxy, Masaaki Yuasa, Ping Pong the Animation serves a tale of ambition with its fair share of bumps along the way.

Seeking to live as a human with his beloved, he made a deal with a fallen god, but he only ended up cursed and dying. When Mikage discovered Tomoe, the god made the youkai forget his human love as a quick solution. However, something has changed recently to reactivate the curse; Tomoe has fallen in love with his new human master, Nanami.

However, their relationship and resolve are put to the test, when romantic feelings conflict with the one and only rule.\n\nBased on Yuki Midorikawa's manga of the same name, Hotarubi no Mori e is a tale of friendship and compromise of two people who should never have crossed paths, as their lives become hopelessly intertwined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.37, "rank": 170, "popularity": 197, "num_list_users": 581925, "num_scoring_users": 323753, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2011-02-27T09:56:28+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-28T23:01:00+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2011, "season": "summer"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 2700, "rating": "g", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/35325.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/35325l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/38229.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/38229l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [], "related_manga": [], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 4081, "title": "Natsume Yuujinchou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/108439.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/108439l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 30}, {"node": {"id": 1689, "title": "Byousoku 5 Centimeter", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/79674.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/79674l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 15}, {"node": {"id": 16782, "title": "Kotonoha no Niwa", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/79676.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/79676l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 14}, {"node": {"id": 199, "title": "Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/79597.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/79597l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 8}, {"node": {"id": 14713, "title": "Kamisama Hajimemashita", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/85429.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/85429l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 6}, {"node": {"id": 457, "title": "Mushishi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/73862.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/73862l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 6}, {"node": {"id": 16528, "title": "Hal", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/46549.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/46549l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 2236, "title": "Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/2432.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/2432l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 9989, "title": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79697.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79697l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 4}, {"node": {"id": 12355, "title": "Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/35721.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/35721l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}], "studios": [{"id": 112, "name": "Brain's Base"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "12003", "completed": "419909", "on_hold": "3170", "dropped": "842", "plan_to_watch": "151010"}, "num_list_users": 586934}}, {"id": 28171, "title": "Shokugeki no Souma", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/72943.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/72943l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Shokugeki no Soma", "Food Wars: Shokugeki no Soma"], "en": "Food Wars!

After hearing Yotarou's desperate appeal for his mentorship, Yakumo is left with no choice but to accept his very first apprentice.\n\nAs he eagerly begins his training, Yotarou meets Konatsu, an abrasive young woman who has been under Yakumo's care ever since her beloved father Sukeroku Yuurakutei, another prolific Rakugo performer, passed away. Through her hidden passion, Yotarou is drawn to Sukeroku's unique style of Rakugo despite learning under contrasting techniques. Upon seeing this, old memories and feelings return to Yakumo who reminisces about a much earlier time when he made a promise with his greatest rival.\n\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a story set in both the past and present, depicting the art of Rakugo, the relationships it creates, and the lives and hearts of those dedicated to keeping the unique form of storytelling alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.6, "rank": 66, "popularity": 663, "num_list_users": 226970, "num_scoring_users": 73381, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2014-12-05T00:57:17+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T00:44:04+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Josei"}], "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2016, "season": "winter"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "02:25"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1560, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75657.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75657l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/77907.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/77907l.jpg"}], "background": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu covers the first five volumes of the manga.

Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.\n\nFor Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the Lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the Lord's successor. \n\nWhile the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had.

Roger was known as the \"Pirate King,\" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece\u2014which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame\u2014and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\n\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes\u2014One Piece.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ", "mean": 8.53, "rank": 91, "popularity": 30, "num_list_users": 1401462, "num_scoring_users": 781251, "nsfw":

With the lead he receives from his cousin, police investigator Daisuke Akimi, Mikiya is led into the underbelly of Mifune City, as the salvation of Shiki's soul lies in his determination to prove her innocence once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.43, "rank": 137, "popularity": 914, "num_list_users": 167069, "num_scoring_users": 90427, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2008-09-06T21:40:12+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T02:08:16+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Thriller"}], "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2009, "season": "summer"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 7283, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/28552.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/28552l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52549.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52549l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/56619.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/56619l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1418/107814.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1418/107814l.jpg"}], "background": "Includes claymation short which was shown before the movie in theaters.", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 5204, "title": "Kara no Kyoukai 6: Boukyaku Rokuon", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/21739.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/21739l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}, {"node": {"id": 6954, "title": "Kara no Kyoukai 8: Shuushou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/78756.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/78756l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "sequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Sequel"}, {"node": {"id": 23697, "title": "Kara no Kyoukai: Manner Movies", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/78704.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/78704l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "other", "relation_type_formatted": "Other"}], "related_manga": [], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 169, "title": "Shingetsutan Tsukihime", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/20669.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/20669l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 5356, "title": "Canaan", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75789.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75789l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 514, "title": "Cossette no Shouzou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/77004.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/77004l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 5177, "title": "Denpa-teki na Kanojo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1722/111810.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1722/111810l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 28701, "title": "Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/72863.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/72863l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 11111, "title": "Another", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75509.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75509l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 356, "title": "Fate/stay night", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/30327.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/30327l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}], "studios": [{"id": 43, "name": "ufotable"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "3041", "completed": "117754", "on_hold": "1614", "dropped": "591", "plan_to_watch": "44656"}, "num_list_users": 167656}}, {"id": 17389, "title": "Kingdom 2nd Season", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53589.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53589l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Kingdom Hisho Hen", "Kingdom: Dai 2 Series"], "en": "Kingdom: Season 2", "ja": "\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c0\u30e0 \u7b2c2\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba"}, "start_date": "2013-06-08", "end_date": "2014-03-02", "synopsis": "A year after the devastating battle against the formidable Zhao, the State of Qin has returned its focus to pursuing King Ying Zheng's ambition of conquering the other six states and unifying China.

Soon, after certain events, Hanamichi is left with two unwavering thoughts: \"I hate basketball,\" and \"I desperately need a girlfriend.\"\n\nOne day, a girl named Haruko Akagi approaches him without any knowledge of his troublemaking ways and asks him if he likes basketball.

Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ", "mean": 8.41, "rank": 147, "popularity": 134, "num_list_users": 724931, "num_scoring_users": 308451, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2007-04-10T14:34:24+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T02:07:34+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2007, "season": "summer"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "friday", "start_time": "00:30"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1480, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/13088.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/13088l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/23537.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/23537l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/32777.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/32777l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51003.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/51003l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/55361.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/55361l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/60567.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/60567l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/92021.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/92021l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1650/108986.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1650/108986l.jpg"}], "background": "Baccano! is based on Ryohgo Narita's award-winning light novels of the same title and mainly adapts the first 4 novels.

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.49, "rank": 108, "popularity": 2, "num_list_users": 2628706, "num_scoring_users": 1821276, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2012-12-05T12:03:21+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T02:29:07+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "num_episodes": 25, "start_season": {"year": 2013, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "sunday", "start_time": "01:58"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44560.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44560l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/55237.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/55237l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56785.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56785l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56787.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56787l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/60591.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/60591l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/60593.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/60593l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63799.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63799l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/104606.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/104606l.jpg"}], "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin adapts content from the first 8 volumes of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.\n\nThe last episode received a pre-airing in Tokyo, Marunouchi Piccadilly 1 theater on Saturday, September 28, 2013.

By taking in Dario's son Dio when the boy becomes fatherless, George hopes to repay the debt he owes to his savior. However Dio, unsatisfied with his station in life, aspires to seize the Joestar house for his own. Wielding an Aztec stone mask with supernatural properties, he sets out to destroy George and his son, Jonathan \"JoJo\" Joestar, and triggers a chain of events that will continue to echo through the years to come.\n\nHalf a century later, in New York City, Jonathan's grandson Joseph Joestar discovers the legacy his grandfather left for him. When an archeological dig unearths the truth behind the stone mask, he realizes that he is the only one who can defeat the Pillar Men, mystical beings of immeasurable power who inadvertently began everything.\n\nAdapted from the first two arcs of Hirohiko Araki's outlandish manga series, JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken follows the many thrilling expeditions of JoJo and his descendants. Whether it's facing off with the evil Dio, or combatting the sinister Pillar Men, there's always plenty of bizarre adventures in store.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.03, "rank": 505, "popularity": 72, "num_list_users": 1015317, "num_scoring_users": 623610, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2012-07-05T06:49:13+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T01:51:35+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Vampire"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "watching", "score": 0, "num_episodes_watched": 0, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2018-10-17T17:39:28+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 2012, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "00:30"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40409.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40409l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/42707.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/42707l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44177.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44177l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/71542.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/71542l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1453/96724.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1453/96724l.jpg"}], "background": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken was announced on July 5, 2012 at a press conference celebrating the 25th anniversary Hirohiko Araki's long-running series.

However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.38, "rank": 167, "popularity": 47, "num_list_users": 1242916, "num_scoring_users": 593065, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2012-03-30T12:22:25+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T01:26:53+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Police"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}], "num_episodes": 22, "start_season": {"year": 2012, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "friday", "start_time": "00:45"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1380, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/41995.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/41995l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43399.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43399l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44630.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44630l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/45408.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/45408l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/74097.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/74097l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74208.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74208l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74458.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74458l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1041/96298.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1041/96298l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1340/100118.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1340/100118l.jpg"}], "background": "An edited version of the series received a rebroadcast starting July 10, 2014. 22 episodes of the original series were combined into eleven 46-minute long episodes with some scenes being slightly extended. \n\nPsycho-Pass aired on Fuji Television's noitaminA block.
